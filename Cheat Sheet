Check list of packages in conda
    Conda List
    
Update all packages in the default environment
    conda upgrade conda
    conda upgrade --all
    
# Check if pip is already installed, by running this command on Terminal/Anaconda Prompt
    pip --version

# Once you have conda installed, run the command below on Terminal/Anaconda Prompt
    conda install pip
    
Install a package into the environment
    conda install PACKAGE_NAME
    conda install numpy scipy pandas
    It's also possible to specify which version of a package you want by adding the version number such as conda install numpy=1.10.
    
Remove Packages
    conda remove PACKAGE_NAME
    
Search a package to install
    conda search '*beautifulsoup*'
    
Create a development environment
    conda create -n my_env python=3.7 numpy Keras
    
Activate an environment
  # For  conda 4.6 and later versions on Linux/macOS/Windows, use
    conda activate my_env
  #For conda versions prior to 4.6 on Linux/macOS, use 
    source activate my_env
  #For conda versions prior to 4.6 on Windows, use 
    activate my_env
    
Deactivate environment
  # For  conda 4.6 and later versions on Linux/macOS/Windows, use
    conda deactivate
  #For conda versions prior to 4.6 on Linux/macOS, use 
    source deactivate
  #For conda versions prior to 4.6 on Windows, use 
    deactivate
    
Saving and Loading Environments
    conda env export
    
Write environment to file
    conda env export > environment.yaml
    
To create an environment from an environment file, use the following command:
    conda env create -f environment.yaml    
    
# If the environment is not activated
    conda list -n env_name

# If the environment is activated
    conda list

# To see if a specific package, say `scipy` is installed in an environment
    conda list -n env_name scipy    
    
Remove environment
    conda env remove -n env_name
    
# First, verify if you have Python and conda installed
# If the command below shows an error, try installing it first using `conda install python=3`
    python --version
    conda --version

# Use either of the commands below to install notebook
    conda install jupyter notebook
    conda install -c conda-forge notebook    
    
# First, verify if you have pip installed. In recent versions of Python 3 >=3.4, pip comes preinstalled. 
# If the `pip` command below shows an error, try installing pip from https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/ 
    python --version
    pip --version


# Use either of the commands below to install notebook
    pip install notebook
    pip install jupyter notebook
